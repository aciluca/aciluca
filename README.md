# 👋 Hi there, I'm Luca

Welcome to my GitHub profile!

## 📚 About Me

I'm currently studying in a post-diploma **Data Analyst** program, where I'm building strong foundations in statistics, machine learning, and data processing. I'm especially passionate about applying data science in meaningful contexts—such as **healthcare**, **biostatistics**, and **process optimization**.

## 💡 Interests

- 📊 Data Science & Machine Learning  
- 🖼️ Data Visualization & Storytelling  
- 🌿 Exploring Nature & the Outdoors
- 📷 Photography and Filmmaking

## 🛠️ Projects & Skills

I enjoy working with:
- Python (NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, scikit-learn, TensorFlow)
- SQL (MySQL, PostgreSQL)
- Docker & Virtual Environments
- Data Visualization

## 📸 Photography

Outside of tech, I'm a self-taught **photographer** with a passion for **motorsports**, **landscape** and **street**. I’m building my portfolio on track and in the field, one shot at a time.

## 🚑 Volunteering

I'm a volunteer **emergency responder** with *Croce Bianca*, where I serve my community with dedication and empathy. It's a role that has shaped me both personally and professionally.

## 🌄 Life Balance

I find energy and peace by spending time in **nature**, whether it's hiking in the mountains or just enjoying a quiet moment outdoors. It helps me recharge and stay focused in everything I do.

## 🤝 Let’s Connect

I’m always open to collaborations, ideas, or just a good chat about data, photography, or life on the road 🚑📷🌲.
