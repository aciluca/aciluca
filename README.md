# 👋 Hi there, I'm Luca

**`Digital Craftman (Data Scientist/Photographer/First Responder)`**

Welcome to my GitHub profile!

## 📚 About Me

I'm currently enrolled in a post-diploma **Data Analyst** program, where I'm deepening my knowledge of data science, from statistics and data wrangling to machine learning and predictive modeling. This path is allowing me to build a solid technical foundation while also learning how to approach real-world problems with a data-driven mindset. 

What fascinates me the most is the potential of data science to create impact — whether it's improving healthcare systems through **biostatistics**, enhancing safety in complex environments like **nuclear energy**, or driving smarter decisions through **process optimization**. I'm motivated by the idea of turning raw data into meaningful insights that can help people and organizations make better choices.
