# 👋 Hi there!!

**`Data Enthusiast & Field Operative (Data Scientist / Photographer / First Responder)`**

Welcome to my GitHub profile!

## 📚 About Me

I'm currently enrolled in a post-diploma **Data Analyst** program, where I'm deepening my knowledge of data science, from statistics and data wrangling to machine learning and predictive modeling. This path is helping me build a solid technical foundation while also learning how to approach real-world problems with a data-driven mindset. 

What fascinates me the most is the potential of data science to create real impact, whether it's improving healthcare systems through **biostatistics**, enhancing safety in complex environments like **nuclear energy**, or driving smarter decisions through **process optimization**. I'm motivated by the idea of turning raw data into meaningful insights that help people and organizations make better choices.

## 💡 Interests
